        <h3><i>Why Elizabeth Holmes, the former biotech entrepreneur who has fallen out of public favor?
            I mean, yes, she might be convicted of criminal fraud, but let's be real here. She should've been 
            convicted for misleading the public and using faulty machines on the public, and not for investor fraud. 
            I mean the whole  idea of investor fraud is kind of strange to be honest. Especiallty here, all these rich 
            men could've just done a background. I mean, aren't you supposed to research the things you invest in? But how
            would I know? I'm just some lousy art student and not a venture capitalist.
