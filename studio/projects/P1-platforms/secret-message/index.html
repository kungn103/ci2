		sometimes I <span>pa</span>u<span>s</span>e and ju<span>s</span>t <span>wo</span>nde<span>r</span> like why <span>d</span>o we exist. 
		sometimes i eat and i just wonder if the soils weren't <span>dead</span> what it would be like without taste. 
		mayber i dont like <span>florals</span>. i dont like mayonnaise. or maybe the idea of mayonnaise scares me. 
		but also i don’t like it when normies try to come for me. i also dont understand
		how some people don’t like zebras. i think they are so cool. like giraffes. 
		i like giraffes. i think they are cool. you know? i wish i didn’t have school!! 
		i HATE school. ughhhhh. i can’t wait until i don’t have school. sometimes i just want 
		to play all day. maybe i could be a penguin. if i were an animal i would definitely be 
		a penguin. i wouldnt have to do anything if i were a penguin. i just have to waddle and 
		slide all day. i wouldnt want to hatch an egg though. that’s too much work. 
		i’m feeling kinda hungry now. i’ve always wanted a pogo stick. i think they’re so fun.
		i really do.
